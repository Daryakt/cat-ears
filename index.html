<h2>The ear consists of three parts:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Outer ear. It consists of the ear flap (also called the pinna) and the external auditory canal.</li>
    <li>Middle ear. It consists of the eardrum and the auditory ossicles (small bones).</li>
    <li>Inner ear (labyrinth). Consists of the sensory structures of hearing and balance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How can a cat's ear hurt?</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Mite</li>
    <li>Dermatitis</li>
    <li>Otitis</li>
    <li>Hematoma</li>
    <li>Necrosis</li>
</ol>

<p>Before cleaning your cat's ears at home, you should prepare the area, as well as all the necessary tools and materials.
    Place a few drops of ear cleaner in each ear.
    Lightly massage each ear.
    Use a cotton swab to remove accumulated dirt and wax using smooth movements from the inside out.
    Pet and calm the cat, treat it with its favorite food.
    With constant carrying out of the procedure, the owner gradually gains the necessary experience, and the animal perceives all manipulations more calmly. With proper skill, the entire process takes no more than a few minutes.</p>
